# Moonraker-Taskbar-Icon
Small Icon in the Taskbar that shows Moonraker Progress. Right click the Application to either exit or set IP-Adress and Progress Color

Explanation of the shortcuts:

- IP: The IP Address you entered can't be resolved into a working address.
- NC: No connection. Can't connect to the Moonraker service. Either its offline or there are other connection issues.
- OK: Print is either finished or no Print file is queued.

If you want to run multiple Instances of the program you need to have multiple directories because of the way Windows Configurations are stored.
